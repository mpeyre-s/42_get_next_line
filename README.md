# ➡️ Competencies Acquired

- **File Descriptor Handling**: Proficiency in working with file descriptors to read data from files or standard input efficiently.

- **Dynamic Buffer Management**: Implementation of flexible buffering strategies to handle varying input sizes dynamically.

- **Memory Management**: Deepened understanding of memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring the proper handling of dynamically allocated memory to prevent leaks.

- **Static Variables**: Utilization of static variables to retain state across multiple function calls, enabling efficient line-by-line reading.

- **Edge Case Handling**: Strengthened ability to manage edge cases, such as EOF, empty files, and varying buffer sizes, ensuring robust and reliable function behavior.
